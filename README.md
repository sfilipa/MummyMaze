<h1>Project Description:</h1>
We developed an application that utilized search algorithms implemented in practical classes to play the Mummy Maze game. For the informed search algorithms, we formulated at least three distinct heuristics suitable for the problem. The program allowed the user to choose a specific level to solve, the search algorithm, and the heuristic to use (if applicable).
<br><br>
We also conducted a comparative study of the performance of the various search algorithms and heuristics used to solve the problems. Specifically, we studied the performance of uninformed search algorithms, the performance of informed search algorithms, the performance of uninformed search algorithms versus informed search algorithms, and the quality of the heuristics used.
